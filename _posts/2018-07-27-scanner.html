<p>FR8Star is a platform that connects shippers who have oversize or overweight cargo with carriers who can haul that
    cargo. Within the last 8 months we've redesigned all of the major flows and created multiple new large features.
    After conducting user research and in-depth interviews with multiple carriers, we uncovered a need to change
    the way they find high quality loads.
</p>
<p>Our research revealed that carriers were tired of traditional load boards and calling their network for jobs was
    too time consuming. That's when the Load Scanner was born. The tool allowed carriers give information about their
    fleet, favorite lanes and upcoming backhauls. The Load Scanner then automatically notified them whenever a matching
    load that met their needs was found. Implementing this feature resulted in a 200% increase in bids - a key performance
    metric - within the first 4 weeks.
