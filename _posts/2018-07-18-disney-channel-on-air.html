<p>These On-Air Motion Graphics were created after re-branding of the channel in order to enhance and celebrate springtime. In collaboration with two talented motion designers we created a series of motion graphics like bumpers, play offs, play ons, promos, lower thirds and other elements according to the channel's style guides. We have four main colors which signify different content during the day. That's why we needed to create 4 different sets of graphics. A lot of work!</p>
