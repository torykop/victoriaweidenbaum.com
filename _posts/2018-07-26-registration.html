<p>FR8Star is a platform that connects shippers who have oversize or overweight cargo with carriers who can haul that cargo. Within the last 8 months we've redesigned all of the major flows and created multiple new large features. After conducting user research and in-depth interviews with multiple carriers, we uncovered a need to change the way they find high quality loads.

<p>In order to properly set up <a href="/scanner/">Load Scanner</a><i class="ajax-link"> we needed a clear onboarding experience that is going to ask a carrier about their preferences and availabilities. We used steps approach in order to break down the experience into easy chunks. After implementing the flow we're seeing a significant and stable growth in carrier registartions.
