<p>On Simbi, you can exchange services with other members or offer to “pay” them for their time using your credits. The task was to explore the possibilities of the deal process. In order to complete the deal users are supposed to share their phone numbers, Skype usernames or meet in person. How could Simbi make them return to the app in order to communicate with each other? My idea was to allow users to create their own schedule, so others can book an appointment with them in order to use their service.</p>
