<p>Based in San Francisco, Brandless is a fresh approach to consumer commerce. Brandless is a community of people who believe that everyone can live better through the stuff we buy and how we buy it. The company's mission is deeply rooted in quality, transparency, and community-driven values.
    </br>
    In collaboration with developers, designers and product managers we built an MVP responsive website and created pixel-perfect interfaces from scratch. Working in Agile sprints, it was exciting designing for e-commerce and exploring optimal solutions for common flows like shopping cart, checkout and others.
