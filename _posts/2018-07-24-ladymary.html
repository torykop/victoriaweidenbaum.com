<p>Based in Sunnyvale, LadyMarry is the #1 wedding planner app on Google Play. With the LadyMarry team we improved the onboarding flow for Android. We interviewed some loyal users using lean user research methodology. It was also important to discover where new users drop off the app and what was triggering it.</p>
<p>
  The solution was to let a user decide whether he/she wants to go through tutorials or sign up and start planning their wedding immediately. As a result the sign up rate increased and more users started planning their wedding with LadyMarry.
