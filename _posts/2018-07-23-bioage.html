<p>Bioage Labs is a computational biology startup which works with human data to get more knowledge on the biology and genetics of aging.</p>

<p>I was inspired by their passionate dedication to the problem of aging and by how hardworking all of the team members are. In collaboration with their CEO, Product Manager and Engineer we designed and implemented their responsive website, logo and marketing materials in order to show their unique approach to a challenging problem.</p>
