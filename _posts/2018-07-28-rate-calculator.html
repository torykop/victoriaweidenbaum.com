<p>FR8Star is a two-sided marketplace that helps shippers with complicated oversize/overweight cargo to find specialized carriers who can move their cargo from A to B. Within the last 8 months we've redesigned all of the major flows and created multiple new large features. 
</p>
<p>'Calculate Rate' is a key feature for shippers that helps them to determine a right trailer for their load, understand prices options, calculate required permits and post a load to FR8Star Carrier network.</p>

<p>Our primary goal was to increase the number of load posts and maximize the number of shippers who choose Price Lock option when posting a load. </p>
